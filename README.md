Mario Bros game with JS language less than 15kb size

This game was created on pure JavaScript. 
I maked this game to train my knowledges in create games and JS Language.

This game contains:

1. Mario
2. Gomba
3. hit box with coin
4. hit box with mushroom
5. block box
6. mushroom
7. coin
8. background
9. sound effect
10. music
11. pause game
12. mario run
13. mario jump
14. mario dead

I removed some things to make smaller file than possible, without losing the essence mario game.

what i removed?
1. Fire Flower
2. Star
3. box with 10 coins
4. koopa troopa
5. carnivorous plant
6. Coin counter
7. Super mario down move
8. entering in pipe
9. secret underground place
10. castle
11. flag on the finish
12. block box destroy effect
13. gomba dead with box effect
14. effect super mario hit
15. effect mario grown to super mario

The game has prepared to do all of this, but my objective is create a similar (not equal) mario game with less than 15kb size.
i needed to sacrify similar things, and any things i removed because have a similar in the game.
ex:. 
gomba=koopa troopa (except the shell)
Coin Counter=Point counter
Castle=Grass, cloud, etc...
Gomba dead with block=Gomba dead
Fire Flower=Mushroom (without move)
Star=Mushroom (with jump move)
etc...

All game contains on the js file, the sound effect and music is separated because is so large and i can't fit this files, and I can't handle it in a good way.

The game support keyboard and gamepad. 
Enjoy.
